# Ferrari-Simulator
Racing game, a car moves in a lap and should reach the finish line before the fuel runs out. The player faces obstacles in the road in Level 1 such as traffic cones and fuel is lost if car crashes into an obstacle and the score is the amount of fuel left in the tank when reaching the finish line, however this can be compensated by collecting collectibles in Level 2 such as fuel powerups that increase the fuel when collected.
